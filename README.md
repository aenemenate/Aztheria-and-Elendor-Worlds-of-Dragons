# Aztheria & Elendor: Worlds of Dragons

This game is being developed for my little sister, who I hope will actually play it. :-P
Included in the repository is both the source code and the bin, as no actual release is ready to take place.

## Building the project

This repository is designed to be built under Windows with the x64 cl.exe compiler. Note that to build you must have installed boost 1.73.0 in the default location and compiled it with the x64 compiler.

Open your x64 Developer Command Prompt and navigate to the project tree.

Navigate to build, then type 'build' to build the game, and 'run' or 'debug', respectively.
