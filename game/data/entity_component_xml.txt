An entity node (any name allowed) can contain any number of subnodes defining components to be held by that entity.

These are the allowed values for those sub-nodes:

<name value="put_name_here"/>

<renderable ch="put_ascii_char" fgcolor="put_fg_color" bgcolor="put_bg_color"/>

<fov viewradius="put_integer"/>

<animalai biome="put_integer"/>
biome values: (biome specifies where to spawn and where not to stray from)
  Desert	= 0
  Mesa		= 1
  Taiga		= 2
  Tundra	= 3
  BorealForest	= 4
  GrassyPlain	= 5
  SnowyPlain	= 6
  MagicalForest	= 7
  HauntedForest	= 8
  TropicalBeach	= 9
  TropicalForest= 10
  BambooForest	= 11
  Swamp		= 12
  SnowyMountain	= 13
  Barren	= 14


The game will randomly select and spawn entities from animals.xml, which should have all of the above defined components
to exhibit expected behavior. Be careful about how your document is defined, as improperly defined xml will crash the program
upon creation of a new world.
